	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>Undercarriage is browned, crisp and chewy, but not hard or burned
		<dd>Cornicione or edge, texture (crumb structure) and flavour is pleasant
		<dd>Thickness appropriate to style and fully baked with no holes, tears, or gumline present
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>Sauce has a pleasant balanced tomato flavour: neither overly sweet nor acidic
		<dd>Sauce is moist and velvety, neither overly dry not wet
		<dd>The amount of sauce is appropriate to the style
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>Fully melted with some browning, but not overcooked or broken
		<dd>The cheese blend has a pleasant, salty, buttery, distinguishable flavour
		<dd>The amount of cheese is appropriate to the style
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>Everything comes together nicely, including any garnish - herbs, salt, olive oil, etc.
		<dd>Setting, service, value, digestability, and misc. impact on experience
	</dl>
	<p>A score of 80 or above is what I'd consider a good slice and worth a stop if you are looking for a nearby slice. A score of 90 or above really hit the mark in every way and is worth a trip out of the way to visit.
	<br><br>Currently working on how to score pizzas that are not a NY-Style. For example, Lilly's had a good slice but by NY Pizzeria criteria it scored very low. And I don't even know how to score a Detroit slice on NY Rules.</p>

		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Zero flop, alligator skin bottom with good deep brown colour. Crackery but not the thinnest, nice and chewy.
		<dd>09/10 - Great taste, chewy, crispy, pillowy soft inside, relatively thin.
		<dd>08/10 - A little thick for a New York Style but incredibly even. No gum and no ramp.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - On the acidic side and bringing a nice fresh tomato taste to the pie. Very tasty and really shining on the slice.
		<dd>09/10 - A good soft velvety soft. Just a hair more loose and it would verge on wet but this really walks the fine line of sauce texture.
		<dd>09/10 - Nice even application of sauce here, not too much nor too little and it really plays well with other components.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Cooked past broken a good bit of grease on top of the slice but not yet becoming an absolute grease fest. Consider a napkin.
		<dd>09/10 - Great cheesy flavour, nice and fatty (but not all from grease) with a little bit of tang present. Definitely a solid cheese blend used.
		<dd>09/10 - Good level of cheese, nice even layer but nothing undercooked or patchy about it. Really suits the style.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - A great slice overall, great composition that always hits the spot. Just be aware of the broken cheese on the full pie slices.
		<dd>+4 - Good eating spot, big dining room, full open view of the ovens and huge ceiling to floor windows, with patio seating available.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>92/100 - Best NY Pizza in the small neighbourhood that is Weddington, and what I personally set as my bar for home pizzamaking.</b>
		<br>Scored based on a whole-pie slice, will need to regrade on a singular slice to see if grease levels compare.

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>08/10 - A little flop present, some deep brown to black on the bottom but largely deeply golden. Not much chew at all but pleasantly crispy. 
		<dd>07/10 - Pale brown to gold, crispy with fluffy pockets here and there. Needs some stronger flavour to make it sing but texture is all there.
		<dd>08/10 - A little thick, slight gumline but crust isn't gummy in your mouth. Each bite is distinctly crispy. Slight ramp.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Pretty strong and with a nice acidity. Really jumps out and carries a beautiful bright flavour to the slice.
		<dd>09/10 - A little wet but with the thicker crust it balances out really nicely and works beautifully. A risky choice but it pays off.
		<dd>09/10 - Even sauce application, not left wanting more but also not feeling like you're eating soup.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Slightly underdone overall and a little pale on the ramp, but unbroken so not greasy. It works
		<dd>10/10 - Great taste and really compliments the sauce. Good fattiness not brought on by the grease. Excellent Ninja Turtle stretch on some bites.
		<dd>08/10 - A little inconsistent between the center and the ramp, had it melted more it would have been a better balance
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Good composition, a stronger crust flavour would bring this right into the 90s. If I lived in Chapel Hill I'd be here two times a week at least.
		<dd>+3 - The pinnacle of busy college town pizza places. I can definitely see this place packed on weekends or after games.

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Beautiful leoparding beneath, some flop, but perfectly crisp and excellent char flavour, verging on New Haven style
		<dd>08/10 - Blistery crust, deep brown and shallow, nice crisp cornicione
		<dd>10/10 - Thinnest slice I've seen so far in Raleigh, very uniform, no holes, expertly tossed
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>06/10 - A little understated, it's not really strong in either direction and it lacks here
		<dd>08/10 - Nice and moist, not soupy or runny, good texture
		<dd>08/10 - Could have used a tiny bit more to make up for weaker flavour (or just up the taste)
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Blasted yet just barely broken, a marvel for how hot that oven must be to get this colour on the crust, good melt, nice job
		<dd>07/10 - Robust but yet not overly cheesy and without a strong flavour, same issue as the sauce
		<dd>09/10 - Good level of cheese, very even spread
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>7/10 - Great looking slice and bake but it needs more punch, dough is really what shines but cheese and sauce need to pick up the slack
		<dd>+2 - Nice view of the wood fired oven, and I'm a sucker for big interior windows with outward-facing bar seating
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>83/100 - I'll have to come back here and try again because I really want to love this pizza, shame it seemed to miss the mark on taste</b>

	<br><font size="+1"><b>Margherita Style</b></font>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Crisp, but slightly doughy and chewy. Paler than one would expect for Margherita pizza
		<dd>08/10 - Cornicione is thin and crispy, not many bubbles
		<dd>06/10 - Gumline is present, inner crust is definitely too thick for a Margherita pie
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - On the bright side with an acidic tang that makes for a tasty sauce
		<dd>09/10 - Great texture, no complaints, the sauce definitely shines on this pie
		<dd>08/10 - Could use a touch more sauce to make this a banger
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Perfect and gooey fresh mozz
		<dd>08/10 - Nice and fresh taste, not overly cheesy but with a distinct flavour
		<dd>08/10 - Good amount, could have let the sauce show a little more
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Basil and tomato slices on top make for a very fresh pie
		<dd>+3 - Lovely outdoor seating, friendly staff
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>83/100 - Don't make this a priority at this place, go for the Detroit style instead.</b>

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>07/10 - No spotting, but zero flop and a crispiness to the bottom
		<dd>08/10 - Nice texture, pillowy and soft
		<dd>07/10 - Pretty thick on the backend, crust is overall pillowy and bready
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Good flavour in the sauce but it doesn't always come through
		<dd>06/10 - A little on the dry side
		<dd>06/10 - Could have used more sauce given the amount of cheese on the slice
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Just melted, pale. Could have used a few more minutes with heat
		<dd>09/10 - Good cheesy tasty that persisted
		<dd>07/10 - Lots of cheese on the slice
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Pleasant slice but not a banger
		<dd>+2 - Cozy but verging into kitschy. Patio is a great space

	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>06/10 - Golden brown, no spotting. Lots of flop on the hold
		<dd>08/10 - Shallow cornicione, crispy all the way through but still good
		<dd>08/10 - Very thin crust, very uniform
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Taste was good but is largely overshadowed by the cheese
		<dd>09/10 - Velvety and with a great texture
		<dd>08/10 - Good, even coverage
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>05/10 - Cooked too long and well past broken: a very greasy slice
		<dd>05/10 - Cheesy flavour is good but it comes from the grease, not the cheese
		<dd>07/10 - Good cheese cover, pretty uniform
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>06/10 - Too greasy, without a doubt
		<dd>+1 - Cozy feel inside but too dark, wish the blinds had been opened
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>70/100 - Would have been good had it been less of a grease-fest</b>

	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Zero flop, slight crispiness but rather soft when you start to chew, needs some better taste. Golden brown with flecks of deep brown
		<dd>06/10 - Pale and pillowy, slightly doughy taste. Way underdone compared to the rest of the pizza
		<dd>07/10 - Consistent with very little ramp to it but considerable gum despite the thinness of the slice
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Not a strong flavour, and actually kind of underwhelming and understated overall. When it does come through it's actually a nice robust taste
		<dd>06/10 - Dry in the mouth, likely overcooked in the oven due to too little sauce
		<dd>05/10 - Too little sauce overall on the slice leading to aforementioned issues. Evenly spread but this needs more on it to really work
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Slightly underdone, no breaking at all but really pretty pale in a lot of places and no stretch
		<dd>05/10 - No real flavour at all coming from the cheese, not sure what happened as it may have been entirely overshadowed by the pepperoni
		<dd>06/10 - Cheese is pretty inconsistent on the slice leading to patchiness
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>06/10 - Unfortunately a pretty weak slice
		<dd>+3 - It really feels like you step back into 1980s New York when you're in here, pretty cool and a nice interior

		<dt><b>66/100 - Would have been good had it been less of a grease-fest</b>
