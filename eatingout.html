	<h1>Pizza Score System</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>Undercarriage is browned, crisp and chewy, but not hard or burned
		<dd>Cornicione or edge, texture (crumb structure) and flavour is pleasant
		<dd>Thickness appropriate to style and fully baked with no holes, tears, or gumline present
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>Sauce has a pleasant balanced tomato flavour: neither overly sweet nor acidic
		<dd>Sauce is moist and velvety, neither overly dry not wet
		<dd>The amount of sauce is appropriate to the style
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>

		<dd>Setting, service, value, digestability, and misc. impact on experience
	</dl>
	<p>A score of 80 or above is what I'd consider a good slice and worth a stop if you are looking for a nearby slice. A score of 90 or above really hit the mark in every way and is worth a trip out of the way to visit.
	<br><br>Currently working on how to score pizzas that are not a NY-Style. For example, Lilly's had a good slice but by NY Pizzeria criteria it scored very low. And I don't even know how to score a Detroit slice on NY Rules.</p>

	<font size="+2"><b><u>The Pizza Times</font></b></u> – 210 S Wilmington St, Raleigh, NC
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Zero flop, good deep brown into slight char colour, nice and crispy on each bite, cornmeal on the bottom nice. Really good dough flavour here.
		<dd>09/10 - Thin and excellent cornicione, crunchy on the outside but super soft and light on the inside. Good taste, great crust. Decent char brings a robustness to the dough.
		<dd>09/10 - On the thicker side for NY style with lots of little bubbles in the undercrust but not gummy at all, super good taste and slightly chewy.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Sauce flavour really shines, brighter and slightly sweet on the front end with good acidity to kick. More robust flavours showing up but still likely not a precooked sauce.
		<dd>09/10 - You get a good amount of sauce in every bite but it's not overy wet nor dripping off of your slice into your lap. Moist but not wet.
		<dd>08/10 - Even application but wishing they pushed it a little closer to the edge so I could have more. Not soupy at all in the center.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Perfect cook, solid melt with craters like the moon. Not broken at all but really good colour, this is a great balance and there's no greasy feel. They won the game of chicken between dough and cheese.
		<dd>09/10 - Good solid cheesy taste, good balance of sharpness and mellowness. Wait a moment for the slice to cool to really let the profile of this cheese hit its peak - if it's too hot, you'll miss it.
		<dd>09/10 - Good, even cheese application ensures you're never without it in a bite.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Good all around slice, great texture, fantastic crust cook and taste. Stronger cheese and sauce flavours brought this place into the '90s where it belongs
		<dd>+4 - Nice spot, big windows, kind people who remember you after just 3 visits, take-out only. No frills and the slice is an even $3 after tax. 
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>96/100 - If I'm on Wilmington this is where you'll find me – I'll always make a stop.</b>
		<br>Previously scored 87/100 - 2022.09.30 and 92/100 - 2022.10.25

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>10/10 - ZERO FLOP with an almost crackery bottom
		<dd>10/10 - Crisp, airy, and excellent. Dough flavour is fantastic
		<dd>09/10 - Bubbly and airy undercarriage with good colour. Not conventional but very good
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - A little acidic but still bright, great taste
		<dd>10/10 - Perfect sauce texture, neither dripping nor dry
		<dd>09/10 - Could have used a smidge more sauce
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Cooked just a hair before breaking, allowing saltiness but not greasiness
		<dd>08/10 - Needed a little more cheesiness in the flavour profile but otherwise good
		<dd>09/10 - Near perfect level of cheese
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Basil on top adds brightness, but the slice was missing a little something I couldn't put my finger on
		<dd>+4 - Nice interior, excellent open window bar seating to outside
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>94/100 - Fantastic dough on this one, definitely worth repeat visits (but why do they only do slices on weekends)</b>

	<font size="+2"><b><u>The Exchange Pizza Depot Matthews</u></b></font> – 213 N Trade St. Suite B, Matthews, NC
	<br><font size="+1"><b>Neopolitan Style Pies</b></font>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>09/10 - No flop but an ultra thin crust with excellent browning and some black spotting. Undercarriage really does well with a good layered flavour profile to support the rest of the pie.
		<dd>09/10 - Beautifully bubbly and airy crust with a good moist fill in the outer ring. Not doughy, but an excellent fresh bready taste with notes of char on the bottom, wow.
		<dd>09/10 - Super even, super thin. If this is hand-tossed it is super impressive. Cooked on a grate.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Sauce is good and acidic with a natural sweetness found in fresh tomatoes which leads me to think they don't used canned product.
		<dd>09/10 - Sauce is wet and typical for the style, but not soupy. A good balance was found here and it rocks.
		<dd>09/10 - Sauce has a good, even dispersion for the style, a nice blanket of tomato that still doesn't way down an uber thin crust.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Unbroken cheese, nice and fresh that isn't solid too quickly when you're trying to eat it.
		<dd>09/10 - Fresh mozz is light and gooey off the bat, almost sloughing off but okay for the style. Fresh milky taste with each bite.
		<dd>09/10 - Typical dispersion for the style, nice globs here and there to let the sauce peek through.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - A very very good slice that was nice and steamy as it hit the outdoor table on the coldest day of the year.
		<dd>+3 - A cute counter joint with lots of outdoor seating right in the center of Matthews.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>93/100 - Very solid slice from a place I noticed by chance, and I'm glad we stopped to visit.</b>

	<br><font size="+1"><b>My Old Haunt - A likely biased review</b></font>
	<br><font size="+2"><b>New York Style</b></font>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Zero flop, alligator skin bottom with good deep brown colour. Crackery but not the thinnest, nice and chewy.
		<dd>09/10 - Great taste, chewy, crispy, pillowy soft inside, relatively thin.
		<dd>08/10 - A little thick for a New York Style but incredibly even. No gum and no ramp.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - On the acidic side and bringing a nice fresh tomato taste to the pie. Very tasty and really shining on the slice.
		<dd>09/10 - A good soft velvety soft. Just a hair more loose and it would verge on wet but this really walks the fine line of sauce texture.
		<dd>09/10 - Nice even application of sauce here, not too much nor too little and it really plays well with other components.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Cooked a bit past broken a good bit of grease on top of the slice but not yet becoming an absolute grease fest. Consider a napkin.
		<dd>09/10 - Great cheesy flavour, nice and fatty (but not all from grease) with a little bit of tang present. Definitely a solid cheese blend used.
		<dd>09/10 - Good level of cheese, good stretch, nice even layer but nothing undercooked or patchy about it. Really suits the style.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - A great slice overall, great composition that always hits the spot and I miss it pretty frequently.
		<dd>+4 - Good eating spot, big dining room, full open view of the ovens and huge ceiling to floor windows, with patio seating available. Biased but the people are great there too.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>93/100 - Best NY Pizza in the small neighbourhood that is Weddington, and what I personally set as my bar for home pizzamaking.</b>

	<font size="+1"><b>Margerita Style</b></font>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Nice leoparding, nice and chewy with a slight initial crisp. Some flop as expected
		<dd>10/10 - Some bubbles on the cornicione, slightly shallow but nice and pillowy, good char
		<dd>08/10 - Very slight gumline in areas, some ramp, but otherwise nice and very thin
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Ultra fresh taste, nice and bright with a strong acidity, really shines
		<dd>08/10 - Good and saucy but not soupy in your pie, it's a great balance
		<dd>09/10 - Good level of sauce with great taste
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Melty, gooey, some spotted areas going on, unbroken
		<dd>08/10 - Tastes great, nice fresh mozz, not greasy at all
		<dd>10/10 - Good level of cheese, good coverage while windows of sauce peek through as desired for this style
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Great composition overall, fresh basil adds some zing to the cheese, dough tastes fantastic, sauce is a winner
		<dd>+3 - Clean and styled almost like a gentrified '50s diner but it really works for this place
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>93/100 - If you want a Margherita/Neapolitan style, this is the place to try</b>

	<br><font size="+1"><b>The Virginia Slice</b></font>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Zero flop, deep gold, crispy yet somehow slightly layered like a biscuit or baklava. A totally different experience from any other pie I've had.
		<dd>08/10 - Shallow but pillowy, great taste in the crust. Verges on doughy when very thick
		<dd>08/10 - Super thin, no gum at all, pretty noticable ramp so the end of this big slice definitely leans towards bready.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - On the acidic side but with a nice robust profile, great sauce
		<dd>08/10 - A little on the wet side but not at all a bad texture
		<dd>09/10 - A good amount of sauce, nice even spread throughout
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Grease is just starting to show through, decent browning in some spots, not overly greasy
		<dd>09/10 - Good cheesy taste, nice tang but not overpowering at all, works well in tandem with other components
		<dd>09/10 - Good level of cheese, neither too much nor too little
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Overall good slice, keeps it simple yet throws a twist at you with the undercarriage style
		<dd>+4 - You can eat in a cozy joint inside and people watch or sit outside and see the state capitol a block away, nice central spot.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>92/100 - Open late, HUGE slices, I've had multiple late night slices here and they always hit the spot</b>

	<br><font size="+2"><b>Sicilian Style</b></font>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Nice and springy, pillowy crust with good chew. Excellent crispiness on the bottom bake without being too greasy or feeling fried.
		<dd>09/10 - Good taste, night and light with bready but not doughy taste. This slice has a lot of bread but doesn't feel heavy.
		<dd>09/10 - Consistent and even, good dough work means this slice isn't too tall or too short anywhere.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Nice and bright, taste jumps out on every bite to really bring a light-tasting slice.
		<dd>08/10 - Sauce is a little wet but it's not a soup, good texture and pleasant in the bite.
		<dd>09/10 - Good and even application, you're not really left missing any.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Cooked a bit pale, you can see some definition in the shreds still. Not broken or greasy but I wish it could get some brown colour even if it means a little breakage.
		<dd>08/10 - Pretty good cheese taste, leans more towards the fresher side due to the slightly underdone bake on it.
		<dd>09/10 - I personally don't mind the full coverage of cheese or the fact that it's over the sauce. It's an even application and it doesn't glob up in your mouth.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - An excellent slice and a good break from the NY style if you're wanting something different while you're here.
		<dd>+4 - Good eating spot, big dining room, full open view of the ovens and huge ceiling to floor windows, with patio seating available. Biased but the people are great there too.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>91/100 - Aside from some lackings in the cheese this is a very good Sicilian slice and the crust is a total winner. Ask for it well-done to remedy this, and maybe a cup of marinara to dip.</b>

		<dd>09/10 - Nice and pillowy crust, super light, good thickness
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Great balance in the sauce, robust yet bright at once
		<dd>08/10 - Nice and saucy, and yet I want more sauce
		<dd>08/10 - Could use a touch more sauce to make this a banger, more even coverage
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - <u>Really good streatch</u> on the cheese here, some TMNT stuff going on
		<dd>09/10 - Uber cheesy with parm topping makes for a great taste
		<dd>08/10 - Cheese under the sauce is nice, good parm on top. Stretchy without clogging up your mouth

		<dd>+3 - Lovely outdoor seating, friendly staff

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>08/10 - A tiny bit of flop on the hold but great colour, good deep brown in a number of areas with a nice gold brown all over. 
		<dd>08/10 - Thin edge so it leans towards a crispy bite but still pillowy, good golden colour. Taste is bready but not overly so, could be a smidge stronger.
		<dd>10/10 - ULTRA thin and very uniform, truly impressive. No gum at all despite the thinness.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Decent brightness and sweetness, not too acidic. Just wish the taste was stronger or a liiitle more sauce was applied to make up because it tastes good.
		<dd>08/10 - Great texture and cooked well, no complaints here.
		<dd>07/10 - Just a little too little, could have used a bit more. Sauce isn't always noticed in every bite due to slight masking by the cheese.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - A tiny bit broken but not greasy at all, perfect done-ness so you're not swimming in grease.
		<dd>09/10 - Nice and great cheese taste that really shines, it balances fattiness with saltiness to really deliver a great cheese top to you.
		<dd>10/10 - Absolutely perfect cover, they must have measured the cheese with a ruler to ensure evenness, and it still gives a good stretch on the bite..
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
		<dd>+4 - Nice spot, kind people, I love it every time I walk in. You can see they all enjoy working there and it shows in the pie.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>89/100 - A strong slice. If it were in my neighbourhood it'd be my go-to</b>

		<dd>08/10 - A little thick on the backend (noticeable ramp) but overall good thinness
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Sauce is a perfect balance of acidity and sweetness. Not too augmented with herbs so the tomato shines through

		<dd>09/10 - No flop, nice crispy bite each time with a little chew. Beautiful brown and some char on the bottom giving great taste. Alligator skin bottom with lots of nice little bubbles.
		<dd>08/10 - Thin and crispy, nice crunch with a little chew. Very good golden to deep brown color. Good taste with slight char, up to snuff for sure.
		<dd>09/10 - Ultra thin, nice. Sliiightest ramp with no gumline, expertly tossed.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - A little acidic on the sauce but it works well for the slice, gives a good overall sharpness.
		<dd>08/10 - A little on the wet side but not overly so, nice counter to the crust.
		<dd>08/10 - Could have used a little more sauce where the ramp forms but otherwise a good amount.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Cooked just past broken, slightly greasier than some other slices but not dripping down your arm so not a big deal.
		<dd>08/10 - Cheese taste was solid, slightly cheesy but not tangy. Definitely a healthy amount of parmesan in the mix
		<dd>09/10 - Good amount of cheese on the slice, perfect even coverage.

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Beautiful leoparding beneath, some flop, but perfectly crisp and excellent char flavour, verging on New Haven style
		<dd>08/10 - Blistery crust, deep brown and shallow, nice crisp cornicione. The char on the bottom gives it a nice grounding and robustness
		<dd>10/10 - Thinnest slice I've seen so far in Raleigh, very uniform, no holes, expertly tossed
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Sauce is good and bright, alternating between acidic and sweet between each bite in a strange dance, but I like it.
		<dd>08/10 - Nice and moist, not soupy or runny, good texture. You don't miss any sauce on this slice
		<dd>08/10 - Good even spread and a solid amount of sauce really makes this a good slice to chow down on
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Blasted yet just barely broken, a marvel for how hot that oven must be to get this colour on the crust, good melt, nice job
		<dd>08/10 - Robust but yet not overly cheesy and without a strong flavour, it could use some acidity or some saltiness but otherwise good.
		<dd>09/10 - Good level of cheese, very even spread and no complaints from me.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>

		<dd>08/10 - A little flop present, some deep brown to black on the bottom but largely deeply golden. Not much chew at all but pleasantly crispy.

		<dd>09/10 - Pretty strong and with a nice acidity. Really jumps out and carries a beautiful bright flavour to the slice.
		<dd>09/10 - A little wet but with the thicker crust it balances out really nicely and works beautifully. A risky choice but it pays off.
		<dd>09/10 - Even sauce application, not left wanting more but also not feeling like you're eating soup.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Slightly underdone overall and a little pale on the ramp, but unbroken so not greasy. It works
		<dd>10/10 - Great taste and really compliments the sauce. Good fattiness not brought on by the grease. Excellent Ninja Turtle stretch on some bites.
		<dd>08/10 - A little inconsistent between the center and the ramp, had it melted more it would have been a better balance
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Good composition, a stronger crust flavour would bring this right into the 90s. If I lived in Chapel Hill I'd be here two times a week at least.
		<dd>+3 - The pinnacle of busy college town pizza places. I can definitely see this place packed on weekends or after games.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>87/100 - Worth a stop, so far the best pizza on Franklin Street.</b>

	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Nice crisp bite, zero flop, good char on the bottom to give a good bready flavour but some spots are almost burned. Good chew on the slice 
		<dd>08/10 - Good evenness, a little thicker undercarriage but no ramp to find, no gumline, pretty good texture across the slice.
		<dd>09/10 - Slightly pillow rim but nice and crispy on the outside so a good contrast for the crust, good flavour too.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Acidic with a good brightness that isn't quite sweet so it works well in conjunction with everything else.
		<dd>08/10 - A bit wet, sauce is probably made from fresh tomatoes which is great. The blend is a little uneven so some big chunks get through which can give an inconsisnent bite.
		<dd>08/10 - Decent spread but with a chunkier sauce like this it can be hard to get it even but it's almost to be expected.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Good buttery flavour in the cheese but it's not over broken so not terribly greasy. Bring a napkin just in case.
		<dd>09/10 - As stated good base flavour but it could have been a little punchier overall. When you get that tang every so often it really kicks well.
		<dd>08/10 - A little bit of a patchy cheese application but it seems intentional so it gets a pass, probably to work with the texture of the sauce.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Good composition but not worth $4 a slice
		<dd>+3 - Great spot right in downtown Cary right near the train station but very, very busy.
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>87/100 - A pretty tasty slice for if you're downtown in Cary and want something hot.</b>

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>09/10 - A little flop on the hold and fold. Undercarriage with dark spots and barely golden spots - cooked fast. 
		<dd>09/10 - Cornicione present and airy but not huge and puffy. Tastes good and bready with a little char to get you there nice.
		<dd>09/10 - Nice thin pull and only the slightest of ramps, no gum.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Sauce is on the acidic side but it's really good to balance out the fattiness of the cheese. Works for the pie.
		<dd>09/10 - Sauce is wet due to dollop application, no fault there as it's meant to be this way
		<dd>08/10 - Sauce is applied on top of the cheese in patches consistent with this style of pie.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Cheese is definitely broken in the center so some flop and greese, good brown spots present with paler areas from the fresh mozz.
		<dd>08/10 - Nice fatty flavour on this slice, offset by the inclusion of fresh mozz on the pie, grease from the drier mozz gives some saltiness and tang.
		<dd>09/10 - Base layer of lower moisture mozz with dabs of fresh mozz. Bold combination and it works, even application
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - When you get everything in a bite it's a solid 9, but the low moisture mozz can overwhelm so I'll settle on an 8 here. The fresh basil kicks ass.
		<dd>+1 - A nice joint in Cary, a modern style inside. Nothing wrong with it but the place itself feels out of the way. 
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>85/100 - This seems to be a hybrid due to their use of lower moisture mozz as a 'base coverage' for the pie. I'll have to come back and get their traditional style.</b>

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Almost-good-chew crust with good browning and a golden colour. Corn meal dusting on the bottom. Not much crispiness in the bite, no flop, good and thin in the center with huge air bubbles on the crust. 
		<dd>07/10 - Very pillowy ridge dusted with parmesan, slightly doughy but good bread, you can taste the molasses they use in the dough and it is an interesting thing here.
		<dd>08/10 - Even and thin, slight ramp on the doughier slices. I think they have to fight every bit of air that wants to form a bubble from making this a pillow, I respect it.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Sauce is on the sweeter side and pretty bright, it's a quality tomato flavour that stands out.
		<dd>08/10 - Wet but good, slightly saucy and drippy if you're not careful.
		<dd>08/10 - Good amount but wet, it is slightly starting to pool up in the center of the pie but that's hard to fight especially with such an active dough.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Slightly broken but not too greasy, good browning in some spots and slightly pale in others.
		<dd>08/10 - Slightly understated cheese taste, not punchy but with a good fattiness to it. Could use a saltier side, and they try to mitigate with the extra parm on the rim but it needs more.
		<dd>08/10 - Cheese soups up towards the center but it's not too greasy or wet yet, just not edge to edge everywhere on the pie. Okay coverage but it's not too bad.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>08/10 - A decent slice with a different taste, not everything needs to be perfect NY or American style, you come to Mellow Mushroom because you want Mellow Mushroom.

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Lotta flop, decent deep brown, some char on the bottom. Decent chew and some pull, not crispy on the bite.
		<dd>08/10 - Decent cornicione and a good flavour. It tastes like molasses is present in the dough, or some whole wheat. Kind of pillowy and I like it.
		<dd>07/10 - Decent thickness but a notable ramp. Very little gum but not too big of a deal.
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - On the sweeter side with an acidic note, doesn't shine through as much as one would like as the cheese is the star of the show.
		<dd>07/10 - On the wetter side but somehow not really noticeable in every bite, it could use more sauce on the pie.
		<dd>07/10 - Feels thin towards the center, not a suuuper even spread of sauce.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Greasy boy, pooling on the top and some barely gold or brown areas.
		<dd>08/10 - Cheesy and fatty, definitely more buttery than tangy and it could do with that sharpness.
		<dd>07/10 - Okay coverage but it slides to the center, a product of the ramp.

		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Zero flop, slight crispiness but rather soft when you start to chew, needs some better taste. Golden brown with flecks of deep brown
		<dd>06/10 - Pale and pillowy, slightly doughy taste. Way underdone compared to the rest of the pizza
		<dd>07/10 - Consistent with very little ramp to it but considerable gum despite the thinness of the slice
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Not a strong flavour, and actually kind of underwhelming and understated overall. When it does come through it's actually a nice robust taste
		<dd>06/10 - Dry in the mouth, likely overcooked in the oven due to too little sauce
		<dd>05/10 - Too little sauce overall on the slice leading to aforementioned issues. Evenly spread but this needs more on it to really work
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Slightly underdone, no breaking at all but really pretty pale in a lot of places and no stretch

		<dd>05/10 - A solid flop on the hold despite a thick crust. A little bit of chew. Pretty pale on the bottom.
		<dd>04/10 - Not much colour at all on the ring, very very pillowy when you bite into it and not the most flavour. Not doughy but a slightly doughy taste.
		<dd>04/10 - Very pillowy, maybe half an inch of undercarriage or more, with a noticeable bit of gum. 
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>06/10 - Pretty sweet tasting sauce when you can taste it, I'm not sure what their blend is but I don't think it's precooked sauce which is a plus.
		<dd>04/10 - You get a lot of your sauce towards the center but as you reach the outer crust it becomes a mere film beneath the cheese.
		<dd>04/10 - Not much sauce leaves this slice feeling more like a cheesy bread to me.
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Brown but not broken, not greasy at all which is a nice surprise.
		<dd>07/10 - Really fatty cheesy taste, but pretty good all things considered. I don't hate it.
		<dd>06/10 - The cheese is pretty evenly applied but there is so much of it on the slice, it almost gives a Ninja Turtles stretch.
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>07/10 - If I'm in Fountain I'll get a slice just because it's reminiscent of pizza. I don't hate it but I wouldn't come here solely for it, and if it was from a real restaurant I'd cry.
