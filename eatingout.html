	<h3>Pizza Score System</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>Undercarriage is browned, crisp and chewy, but not hard or burned
		<dd>Cornicione or edge, texture (crumb structure) and flavour is pleasant
		<dd>Thickness appropriate to style and fully baked with no holes, tears, or gumline present
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>Sauce has a pleasant balanced tomato flavour: neither overly sweet nor acidic
		<dd>Sauce is moist and velvety, neither overly dry not wet
		<dd>The amount of sauce is appropriate to the style
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>Fully melted with some browning, but not overcooked or broken
		<dd>The cheese blend has a pleasant, salty, buttery, distinguishable flavour
		<dd>The amount of cheese is appropriate to the style
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>Everything comes together nicely, including any garnish - herbs, salt, olive oil, etc.
		<dd>Setting, service, value, digestability, and misc. impact on experience
	</dl>
	<p>A score of 80 or above is what I'd consider a good slice and worth a stop if you are looking for a nearby slice. A score of 90 or above really hit the mark in every way and is worth a trip out of the way to visit.
	<br><br>Currently working on how to score pizzas that are not a NY-Style. For example, Lilly's had a good slice but by NY Pizzeria criteria it scored very low. And I don't even know how to score a Detroit slice on NY Rules.</p>

		<br><br>
		<dt><b>94/100 - Fantastic dough on this one, definitely worth repeat visits (but why do they only do slices on weekends)</b>

		<dt><b>74/100 - A tasty slice but not NY Style <font style="color:red"><u>(Needs another ranking system for fair scoring - will revisit)</u></font></b>

	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>06/10 - Golden brown, no spotting. Lots of flop on the hold
		<dd>08/10 - Shallow cornicione, crispy all the way through but still good
		<dd>08/10 - Very thin crust, very uniform
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>07/10 - Taste was good but is largely overshadowed by the cheese
		<dd>09/10 - Velvety and with a great texture
		<dd>08/10 - Good, even coverage
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>05/10 - Cooked too long and well past broken: a very greasy slice
		<dd>05/10 - Cheesy flavour is good but it comes from the grease, not the cheese
		<dd>07/10 - Good cheese cover, pretty uniform
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>06/10 - Too greasy, without a doubt
		<dd>+1 - Cozy feel inside but too dark, wish the blinds had been opened
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>70/100 - Would have been good had it been less of a grease-fest</b>
