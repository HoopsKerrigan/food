	<h3>Pizza Score System</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>Undercarriage is browned, crisp and chewy, but not hard or burned
		<dd>Cornicione or edge, texture (crumb structure) and flavour is pleasant
		<dd>Thickness appropriate to style and fully baked with no holes, tears, or gumline present
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>Sauce has a pleasant balanced tomato flavour: neither overly sweet nor acidic
		<dd>Sauce is moist and velvety, neither overly dry not wet
		<dd>The amount of sauce is appropriate to the style
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>Fully melted with some browning, but not overcooked or broken
		<dd>The cheese blend has a pleasant, salty, buttery, distinguishable flavour
		<dd>The amount of cheese is appropriate to the style
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>Everything comes together nicely, including any garnish - herbs, salt, olive oil, etc.
		<dd>Setting, service, value, digestability, and misc. impact on experience
	</dl>
	<p>A score of 80 or above is what I'd consider a good slice and worth a stop if you are looking for a nearby slice. A score of 90 or above really hit the mark in every way and is worth a trip out of the way to visit.
	<br><br>Currently working on how to score pizzas that are not a NY-Style. For example, Lilly's had a good slice but by NY Pizzeria criteria it scored very low. And I don't even know how to score a Detroit slice on NY Rules.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><b>CRUST</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Zero flop on the slice, good dark spotting with a rich brown undercarriage
		<dd>08/10 - A little dense but nice and chewy - not crunchy the whole way through
		<dd>08/10 - A little thick on the backend (noticeable ramp) but overall good thinness
		<dt><b>SAUCE</b>
		<dd>10/10 - Sauce is a perfect balance of acidity and sweetness. Not too augmented with herbs so the tomato shines through
		<dd>07/10 - A little saucy but still good due to great flavour
		<dd>08/10 - As said above, just a little saucy but not a bad thing
		<dt><b>CHEESE</b>
		<dd>08/10 - Could have used a little more time, cheese was a little pale
		<dd>10/10 - Excellent taste on the cheese, they have a good blend
		<dd>09/10 - Good cheese level all around
		<dt><b>ET. AL.</b>
		<dd>09/10 - Good composition overall, the sauce and cheese work together very well
		<dd>+3 - Good interior, lots of TVs but nice view of the kitchen
		<br><br>
		<dt><b>89/100 - An Excellent Slice and well worth a stop</b>
