	  <p>I have been seriosuly trying to make pizza since sometime in 2016 when I started working at a pizza place in high school. At first, I didn't quite know what I was doing and I simply tried to put together components from other recipes into something that resembled pizza. I would do same-day doughs that were adapted from my mom's cinnamon roll recipe, I would make a tomato sauce and let it simmer on the stove for hours, and I'd use whatever store brand mozzerella cheese was available because it was cheapest. I'd usually bake it on a baking sheet, on an aluminium pan, or in a cast iron skillet at 400F for 20 minutes, not yet fully recognizing the relationship between temperature, cook time, and flavour.
	  <br><br>Over time, I have done a lot of reading, a lot of watching, and a lot of pizza making at tasting in order to refine my pizza recipe that mimics a sort of NY-style. I recognize that there are still lots of ways to improve but I do think I churn out some very tasty pizzas using this recipe and technique. I also plan to include recipes for other styles of pizza such as Sicilian, Nonna, Detroit, Chicago thin-crust, and deep dish pizzas. Following this recipe is the long process of how I got to this point and some crucial changes I have made in my recipe along the way.
