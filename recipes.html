	<p>Here is an ongoing list of recipes I've learned, adapted, and/or stolen since I've started cooking. I try to give credit if I can remember where it was lifted from.
	<br><br>Feel free to play around! Cooking is subjective, so tweak as you see fit. I don't claim ownership or that there's a "right" way to do a lot of cooking.
	<br><br> Some handy conversions for making things vegan: Butter can be substituted 1:1 with your vegan fat of choice. 1/4 to 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce works for eggs in baking. Water or your choice of milk substitute works instead of milk. Coconut milk usually works in the place of heavy cream (except for whipping – use aquafaba)

	<h2><u>BASICS</u></h2>
	<h3><u>Cake Frosting</u></h3>

	<h3><a id="chickensalt"><u>Chicken Salt</u></a></h3>
	<p>"Australia's Best-Kept Secret!"</p>
	<ul>
	   <li>½ cup table salt
	   <br>
	   <li>¼ cup garlic powder
	   <br>
	   <li>1½ teaspoons white pepper
	   <br>
	   <li>1½ teaspoons celery salt
	   <br>
	   <li>¼ cup paprika
	   <br>
	   <li>1½ teaspoons onion powder
	   <br>
	   <li>1 teaspoon MSG
	</ul>
	<p>Combine all ingredients in a mason jar and shake well</p>
	<br><br>

	<h3><a id="masterstock"><u>Liquid Stock</u></a></h3>
	<p>Make use of vegetable scraps collected over time. Store scraps in the freezer until ready to use. Use your biggest pot.
	<ul>
	   <li>Onions
	   <br>
	   <li>Carrots
	   <br>
	   <li>Celery
	   <br>
	   <li>Mushrooms
	   <br>
	   <li>Garlic
	   <br>
	   <li>Bones, fat, trimmings, etc. from chicken, turkey, pork (OPTIONAL)
	</ul>
	Brown veggies with light oil – DO NOT BURN.
	<br><br>If using meat/bone scraps, roast in the oven until browned before using.
	<br><br>When browned, add a generous amount of water (more than enough to cover). Bring to a boil, add light salt, then reduce to a simmer.
	<br>Simmer 6-8 hours on low, slightly uncovered.
	<br><br>Allow to cool, strain into storage containers and store in the fridge up to 2 weeks or freezer up to 6 months.
	</p>
	<br><br>

	<h3><u><a id="pansauce">Pan Sauce Technique</u></a></h3>
	<p>To be used on any pan that has developed an unburned fond while cooking. Particularly handy as it can be made in the 5-10 minutes needed for meat to rest.
	<br><br>On medium heat, deglaze pan with any liquid. White wine, red wine, stock or broth are excellent, but just water will work. 
	<br>As you deglaze, scrape the fond from the pan to prevent burning.
	<br><br>Add minced garlic, shallot, rosemary, thyme, etc. – Any herbs or aromatics of your choice.
	<br><br>Continue stirring and allow to thicken. Reduce to a glaze that can cover the back of a spoon.
	<br><br>Remove from heat and add a tab of butter, swirling in the pan to form an emulsion. Serve alongside or atop meal.
	</p><br><br>
	
	<h3><a id="picklingliquid"><u>Pickling Liquid</u></a></h3>
	<p>Very basic, not necessarily meant for long-term storage. For a sterile and long-term pickling, look elsewhere. For some of my favourite things to pickle:
	<ul>
	   <li>Peppers
	   <br>
	   <li>Onions
	   <br>
	   <li>Carrots
	   <br>
	   <li>Cucumbers
	</ul>
	Recipe can be easily scaled, just do 1:1 water to vinegar to fit your vessel. For the pickling liquid:
	<ul>
	   <li>1 cup water
	   <br>
	   <li>1 cup white vinegar
	   <br>
	   <li>2 Tablespoons Sugar
	   <br>
	   <li>1 Tablesoon Salt
	   <br>
	   <li>2 cloves Garlic
	</ul>
	Chop to-be-pickled ingredients to desired size. Place in storage containers (mason jars work well) with garlic.
	<br><br>Combine brine ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
	<br>Add brine to jar(s) with to-be-pickled ingredients, allow to cool 15 minutes before sealing.
	<br><br>Refrigerate up to 2 weeks.
	</p><br>

	<h3><a id="whippedcream"><u>Whipped Cream</u></a></h3>

	<h2><u>SAUCES</u></h2>
	<h3><a href="gravy"><u>Brown Gravy</u></a></h3>
	<br><br>
	<h3><a id="gabegreen"><u>Gabe's Green Sauce</a></u></h3>
	<p>
	Shared by my friend Gabe, and it is intended to be used as a sauce for tamale filling but I could imagine it working well in any number of ways.
	<ul>
	<li>10 to 12 tomatillos
	<li>1 to 3 jalapeño
	<li>1 yellow onion
	<li>10 to 12 garlic cloves
	<li>Vegetable oil
	</ul>
	Wash all items and cut in half, then lightly coat in vegetable oil. Roast at 425F for 45 minutes, flipping items halfway through.
	<br><br>Look for slight charring but do not let items burn. Blend all ingredients together (take care when blending hot ingredients) and use as intended.
	<br><br>
	<h3><u>Hot Sauce</u></h3>
	
	<h3><u><a id="hummus">Hummus</a></u></h3>
	Pair with mini toast.

	<li>2 cups chickpeas, cooked or canned
	<li>1/4 cup lemon juice
	<li>1/4 cup tahini paste
	<li>4 cloves garlic
	<li>2 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
	<li>1 teaspoon cumin, ground
	<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, ground
	<li>2 - 3 Tablespoon aquafaba
	<li>1 Tablespoon salt
	<li>3/4 cup roasted bell pepper (optional)
	</ul>
	Combine all in a food processor and blend until smooth.<br><br>
	
	<h3><u>Peruvian Aji Sauce</u></h3>
	<h3><u>Pizza Sauces</u></h3>

	<h3><u><a id="roja">Roja Sauce</a></u></h3>
	<p>Great as a marinade.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>4-5 Guajillo chiles
	<li>4-5 Pasilla chiles
	<li>2 heads garlic
	<li>3 tomatillos, peeled
	<li>Juice from one lime
	<li>Juice from one orange
	<li>1 teaspoon cumin
	<li>1 Tablespoon dried oregano
	<li>1 Tablespoon salt
	<li>Ground pepper
	</ul>
	Boil the chiles until tender. Remove the stems and seeds.<br><br>
	Combine all ingrendients and blend on high until smooth.<br><br>

	<h3><a id="pesto"><u>Pesto</u></a></h3>
	<p>Lifted from You Suck at Cooking.</p>
	<ul>2 cups fresh basil
	<li>½ cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
	<li>½ cup grated parmesan
	<li>2 Tablespoons pine nuts/walnuts
	<li>2 cloves garlic
	<li>Squeeze of lemon
	<li>Additional salt, if desired
	</ul>
	<br>
	Blend thoroughly until uniform in a food processor.
	<br><br>Best if used immediately after making.
	<br><br>

	<h3><a id="thaidip"><u>Thai Peanut Dip</u></a></h3>
	Good for parties or brunches.
	<ul>
	<li>2 cups coconut milk
	<li>½ cup smooth peanut butter
	<li>1/4 cup sambal
	<li>2 Tablespoon rice vinegar
	<li>1 Tablespoon soy sauce
	<li>1 Tablespoon honey
	<li>3 cloves garlic, minced or crushed
	<li>1 teaspoon chili powder
	Simmer on medium heat and stir until slightly thickened. Allow to cool.<br><br>
	If sauce is too thick upon cooling, consider thinning out with additional coconut milk.<br><br>

	<h3><a id="tomatosauce"><u>Tomato Sauce</u></a></h3>
	<p>Used for pasta and the like (not pizza). If desired, add cooked, ground sausage.
	<ul>
	<li>4 tablespoons olive oil
	<li>2 tablespoons basil, finely chopped
	<li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds
	<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper
	<li>6 large cloves finely chopped garlic
	<li>1 tablespoon oregano
	<li>1 teaspoon salt
	<li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
	<li>2 teaspoon sugar
	<li>56 to 60 oz crushed tomatoes
	</ul>
	<br>In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic and stir for 30-45 seconds (until golden brown). Add herbs, seeds, salts, and peppers. Stir.
	<br><br>Add tomatoes, sugar, mix well.
	<br><br>Bring to a boil for 60 seconds, stirring constantly, before reducing to a simmer for at least 30 minutes but ideally four hours, uncovered.
	<br><br>It will bubble and splatter initially, continue stirring until it can remain at a bare simmer without mess.
	<br><br>
	<h3><a id="pumpkinmushroom"><u>Pumpkin Mushroom Sauce</u><a></h3>
	<p>A nice autumnal sauce that works well with most any type of pasta.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>2 cups pureed pumpkin
	<li>1-2 handfuls brown mushrooms, rinsed and julienned
	<li>2-4 garlic cloves, minced
	<li>Sage, ground or fresh
	<li>1 - 2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
	<li>¼ to ½ cup grated parmesan
	<li>½ cup stock
	<li>Salt and Pepper, to taste
	</ul>
	<br>On medium heat, sautee your sage and half of your garlic in the oil until armoatic (45 seconds to 1 minute).<br>
	<br>Add pumpkin puree and stock to combine, bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer.<br>
	<br>In another pan, cook mushrooms on medium heat with no oil, stirring occassionally. Allow them to lose all moisture.<br>
	<br>?When mushrooms have lost most all of their water, add oil and allow to crisp up. Add a pinch of salt and remove from heat.<br>
	<br>Add mushroom oil and most of your mushrooms to the pumpkin sauce, reserving some mushrooms for garnish.<br>
	<br>Stir in parmesan to desired taste and consistency. Add remaining garlic and allow to cook 5 more minutes before serving.<br>
	<br>Toss with desired pasta, garnish with parmesan and remaining crispy mushrooms.<br><br>

	<h2><u>BREADS</u></h2>
	<h3><u><a id="bagels">Bagels</u></a></h3>

	   <li>2 cups warm water
	   <li>1 Tablespoon honey
	   <li>1 Tablespoon yeast
	   <li>1 Tablespoon salt
	   <li>5 cups bread flour

	   Roll into a bagel shape, with the hole 3x larger than you want your finished hole size to be. Place onto a sheetpan with parchment paper and cornmeal.<br><br>
	   Loosely cover and allow to rise 30 minutes.<br><br>
	   In strongly boiling water, boil each bagel 1 to 2 minutes per side (longer for chewier). Apply a wash and add desired bagel toppings.<br><br>
	   Immediately bake at 425F for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.<br><br>

	<h3><u>Banana Bread Loaf</u></h3>
	<p>I've included up to 5x the recipe here as it's easy to have bananas go bad and it's always great to make a lot of banana bread to freeze.</p>

	<h3><a id="gumbo"><u>Gumbo</u></a></h3>
	<p>Gumbo recipes are more a set of guidelines than an actual recipe, so use your heart when making it. This recipe goes hard and fast with the roux but if you want to take it low and slow go for it - I recommend as dark a roux as you can get without actually burning anything.
	<ul>
	<li>All-Purpose Flour
	<li>Neutral Oil
	<li>Celery
	<li>Yellow Onion
	<li>Green Bell Pepper
	<li>Garlic
	<li>Okra (either fresh or frozen)
	<li>Stock
	<li>Beer, 1 can, of your preferred flavour – I tend to use a darker beer but anything can work
	<li>Salt and Pepper
	<li>Jalapeño (Optional)
	<li>Chicken Thigh (Optional)*
	<li>Smoked Sausage, cut into coins (Optional)*
	<li>White rice for serving
	</ul>
	&emsp;&emsp;*These can be replaced by an adequately-seasoned imitation meat or seitan
	<br><br>It's important to have everything ready and in place for any recipe, but it's especially important when working on a roux and doing it quickly as in this recipe.
	<br><br><font style color="red"><b>DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM YOUR ROUX.</b></font>
	<br><br>Dice your trinity vegetables (celery, yellow onion, and green bell pepper), and okra into roughly equal portions. I usually do a double-handful of each if I want to make enough gumbo to last a week or more, but you can get away by using a smidge less okra than the other veggies.
	<br><br>Mince your garlic very finely, more is better. Anything less than a full head of garlic in this recipe isn't enough. If using jalapeño, one or two is usually enough to mince and add.
	<br><br>If you are using chicken thigh, give it a good sear on both sides for a solid browning and set aside, ensuring to deglaze the pan to collect the fond.
	<br><br>Once again, have everything you need within arm's reach as it's important you don't neglect your roux, especially if you haven't made one before.
	<br><br><b>In a deep cooking pan (preferably without a nonstick coating)</b>, pour your neutral oil. You are looking for a <b>1:1 ratio by volume of oil to flour</b>, so have both ready to go. For about a gallon of gumbo, ½ cup each of oil and flour should be enough.
	<br><br>Turn your heat up to maximum – most gumbo recipes will suggest a very low and slow cooking of your roux as it can be more forgiving when it comes to burning.
	<br><br>When the oil starts to smoke, pour in your flour and stir <b><u>constantly</u></b>. By doing this at a much higher heat, we get a shorter cook time (10-15 minutes vs 45) at the expense of constant stirring. I've found that a wooden spoon or whisk works best to keep things moving.
	<br><br>The trick to this is to use your eyes and your nose - look for any areas where it looks like the flour is sticking and scrape quickly, ensuring to scrape the sides of the pot if any roux gets up there. You are looking to frequently move all areas of the pan to prevent burning.
	<br><br><font style color="red"><b>IF YOUR ROUX BURNS, THROW IT AWAY AND START AGAIN</b></font>. It's a delicate balance but it happens. Use your nose to smell for burning but be mindful that as your flour cooks it'll likely smell a little like overdone popcorn. You'll notice the colour of the roux go from white to blond to that of a milky coffee as it gets darker.
	<br><br><b>You are looking for an end colour that is similar to that of a Hershey's chocolate bar. It should be uniform in colour and without any burned bits floating around.</b>
	<br><br>When you reach this state of the roux, throw your trinity vegetables (and jalapeño if using) in to get them to sweat. Stir around and add a pinch of salt to help them release their water. After a few minutes of stirring, they should be more tender and the onions should become slightly translucent. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds to a minute before adding about a cup of your chosen beer, reducing heat to medium.
	<br><br>Stir occasionally after adding the beer to help form the gravy, then add your stock. As a general rule use about a quart of stock for each ½ cup of oil used in your roux. Slowly add the stock in a steady stream so as to prevent a lumpy gravy and to form a uniform mixture.
	<br><br>Add a <b>generous amount</b> of black pepper (keep it controlled but more than you think you need), okra and chicken and/or sausage or substitute (if using). Reduce heat to a <u>very gentle simmer</u> and cover, allowing to cook for at least 4 and up to 8 hours. The long, low and slow cook time on the full stew helps cook out the bitterness of the toasted flour from earlier. Longer is generally better but keep it low and controlled. A boil will turn your veggies to mush.
	<br><br>When ready to serve, pour a big bowl over white rice and add hot sauce to taste.
	<br><br>Store in the fridge after cooling or freeze up to a month.

	<h3><u><a id="soupy">Kale Soupy</u></a></h3>
	<p>Kale works really well in this soup, especially the kind with curly leaf ends as the soup is sucked up in there and is carried right to your gob. This recipe was given to me by my sister-in-law Caroline and it was a quick favourite of mine.
	<ul>
	<li>2 sweetpotatoes, peeled and cubed
	<li>1 yellow onion, chopped
	<li>1 jalapeño, seeds removed and minced
	<li>2 quarts stock
	<li>1 cup dry lentils, soaked in water for 20 minutes
	<li>1 bunch kale, washed and with central stems removed (leaf pieces the size of a playing card work well)
	<li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary
	<li>1 heaping tablespoon minced garlic
	<li>Extra virgin olive oil
	<li>Salt and Pepper to taste
	</ul>
	In a saucepan, bring olive oil to temp over medium heat. Add onion and sweetpotato, stir until tender but before onions go fully transluscent.
	<br><br>Add garlic, stir for 30 seconds, then add stock and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
	<br><br>Allow to simmer for 30 minutes to an hour before serving.

	<h3><u>Pho</u></h3>

	<h3><a id="stew"><u>One-Pot Master Stew</u></a></h3>
	<p>Brown Stews are easy because they can be anything, so here's a set of guidelines rather than a strict recipe. This freezes very well and can be made in large batches for meal prep.
	<ul>
	<li>Meat (Beef Chuck is a solid choice for this stew) (~2 lb, Cut into cubes/cube shapes)
	<li>Vegetables, cut into large pieces (they'll shrink in the stew)
	<li>Gravy Mix, one packet
	<li>Broth or Stock
	<li>Water
	<li>Flour (at least 1/4 cup -- you'll be adding it to desired thickness)
	<li>1 clove garlic, minced
	</ul>
	<br>If using meat, you'll typically want a 1:1 ratio on vegetables to meats, each. For onions, make it closer to 1:1/2 meat to onions. Eyeball it and do it to your liking.
	<br><br>Brown the meat first in the pot you'll be using for your stew. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Generously salt and pepper the meat. Add and cook until brown on ALL sides (only do a few pieces at a time, you don't want to crowd it)
	<br><br>Dice onions into very small pieces so they just disappear into the stew. Have your firm vegetables diced and ready. Carrots, celery, water chestnuts, mushrooms, etc. are all good choices.
	<br><br>For potatoes/peas/soft vegetables, leave them out of your mix for now. Those go in later.
	<br><br>On medium-low heat, sweat the onions for a few minutes until they begin to go translucent. Add garlic and other firm vegetables. Cook for a few more minutes. 
	<br><br>Add a generous pinch of flour (enough to coat all veggies), stir and cook for several minutes.
	<br><br>Add a small amount of stock or broth and stir until the flour has pretty much dissolved.
	<br><br>Throw meat (if any) back into the mix, then top off with your stock or broth so that the whole mix is just covered.
	<br><br>Bring to a boil for a minute or two, then drop to a simmer. Add a pinch of pepper and taste, add salt if desired. <font style color="red">You can always add more salt but can never take it out</font>.
	<br><br>If using potatoes, let the stew simmer for ~2h before throwing them in, otherwise they'll be mush. Cover again and cook until potatoes become fork tender (~60 min at a strong simmer).
	<br><br>If using peas, throw these in at the last 10 minutes or so (20-30 if frozen).
	<br><br>Within that last half hour or so, add your brown gravy packet, little by little so as not to clump, to thicken. If still too thin, add additional flour teaspoon by teaspoon, adding water if necessary. Be careful not to drop in too quickly or it will clump horribly.
	<br><br>Alternatively, add a cornstarch slurry to thicken to desired consistency, stirring constantly while adding.

	<h3><a id="stuffing"><u>Stuffing/Dressing</u></a></h3>
	<p>Here's a guide to make stuffing, using any bread of choice (whole wheat or cornbread being the most common).
	<ul>
	   <li>Bread of Choice
	   <li>1 head celery, diced
	   <li>2 to 3 large carrots, diced
	   <li>1 yellow onion, diced
	   <li>½ cup butter
	   <li>1 quart stock
	   <li>Dried Sage
	   <li>Dried Thyme
	   <li>Salt and Pepper
	</ul><br>
	Use the recipe for <a href="#cornbread">cornbread</a>. If using a bread loaf, you can use an entire loaf of any bread you want – whole wheat or sourdough work very well.
	<br><br>For whichever bread you choose, rip it up into pieces slightly larger than how large you want them in the final product. Place ripped bread onto a baking tray and bake at 150F for up to two hours, taking time to crumble and rearrange the bread crumbs to ensure even drying.
	<br><br>In a saucepan on medium heat, melt fat fully and put celery, carrots, and onion (in equal portion by volume) into the saucepan. Stir and allow to cook until tender but not fully softened. Add generous pinches of salt, pepper, and heaping spoonfuls of sage and thyme (be generous).
	<br><br>Add bread (in an equal amount to the total vegetable volume), stir together, and add stock until mixture has desired moisture (it depends on how wet or dry you want your stuffing).
	<br><br>Place stuffing mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350F for 30 to 45 minutes or until the top is crispy.
